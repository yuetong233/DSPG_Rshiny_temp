# Purpose:
# This script conducts the core analysis of the project using the cleaned datasets.
# It applies statistical, econometric, or machine learning models as required,
# generates key results, tables, and figures, and saves outputs for reporting.
# The script should be reproducible, allowing anyone to rerun the analysis
# from the prepared data to the final results.
