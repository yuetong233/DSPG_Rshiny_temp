# Purpose:
# This script handles the acquisition of raw data required for the project.
# It connects to external sources (e.g., APIs, databases, or public repositories),
# downloads datasets, and saves them into the `raw_data/` folder for further use.
# The script ensures reproducibility by documenting download parameters,
# access credentials (if needed), and file versioning.
