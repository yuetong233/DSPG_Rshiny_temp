# Purpose:
# This script processes and cleans the raw datasets obtained in 01_download.R.
# Typical steps include:
#   - Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
#   - Standardizing variable names, units, and formats
#   - Merging data from multiple sources when necessary
#   - Producing tidy, analysis-ready datasets
# The cleaned outputs are stored in the `cleaned_data/` folder.
