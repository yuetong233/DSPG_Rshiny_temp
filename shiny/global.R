# Purpose:
# This script stores objects and code that need to be shared between the UI
# and server components of the Shiny application.
# Typical contents include:
#   - Loading libraries required across the app
#   - Defining global constants, parameters, and themes
#   - Loading and preparing datasets used by multiple modules
#   - Defining helper functions that are called in both UI and server
# Anything placed in global.R is executed once when the app starts and is
# accessible throughout the app environment.
