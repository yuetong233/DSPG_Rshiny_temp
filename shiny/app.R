# Purpose:
# This is the main entry point for the Shiny App.
# It defines the user interface (UI) and server logic, or sources them from
# separate files if modularized. When the app is launched, app.R initializes
# the Shiny session, loads required libraries, and orchestrates the connection
# between UI inputs, server-side computations, and outputs (plots, tables, maps, etc.).
# Running `shiny::runApp()` will execute this file to start the application.
